# Quiz App with React

In this project, you can see four dropdown menu and you can get the questions what you want. I used the external loader when the questions loading. <br/>
You can add loader from the npm like that.<br/>
### npm install react-loader
I used https://opentdb.com for get the questions from the api.
<br/>
I have a four dropdown menu and lots of items. That's why I kept my dropdown values in the data.json.
